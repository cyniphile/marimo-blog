        # The First Blog Post You Should Read about Gaussian Processes (With Interactive Plots) 

        ## Why Read This Post?
        Is this the 10th blog post you've read about Gaussian Processes and still don't quite understand them?

        When I set out to learn about "Gaussian Processes" (really Gaussian Process Regression), I ended up jumping around between many different resources and it took hours before the core idea hit me. This post should get you to **core idea in ~30 minutes using interactive plots**.

        After that, I'd encourage you to read the references at the end for more detail and rigor. They'll now be more digestible.

        ## Why Gaussian Process Regression?

        <!-- I've always been intrigued by Gaussian Processes regression. It has a certain air of mystery about it...one of those models for the cool kids. GPR is supposed to be "beautiful", but also pretty hard to understand. All I knew about it was the following:  -->

        1. It's a non-linear regression model 
        1. It also does built-in modeling of uncertainties (cool!)

        The following plot from the sci-kit learn documentation shows the output of GP regression model. Note the beautifully curved uncertainty bands. Where does all this come from?

The better an antibody sticks, the better it is at fighting COVID (more or less). Importantly, each different antibody was measured for its binding strength three times, and the measurements were noisy. So we have a problem with:

        1. Nonlinear relationships 
        1. Noisy data (uncertainty is important!) 
        1. Dataset not huge.

        ## GP Regression: The One Line Definition
        Turns out GP regression can be described in one (somewhat loaded) line:

        **GP Regression: A Multivariate Gaussian Distribution over functions, conditioned on some training data.**

        Hmm. Maybe not so terrible? But how does this connect to the idea of "a nonlinear regression that models uncertainty"?

        Let's unpack this definition bit by bit, starting with "distribution over functions".

        ## Prequel: Distributions over Functions

        We all know linear regression; it has the form $y = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$. We have some data $x$ and $y$, and we want to find the $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ that describe a line of best fit. We can do this using OLS (ordinary least squares), and we end up with a linear function $f(x) = \beta_0 + \beta_1 x$, that for any $x$ gives us a prediction for $y$.

        But what if we want some notion of the uncertainty of our prediction?

        Even though the data on the left is much more noisy, both linear regressions model the data with the sample simple line. There's no measure of uncertainty. Let's try to add some.

        What if (just for fun) we assumed $\beta_0$ and $\beta_1$ were actually random variables, and that they are normally distributed with variance equal to the variance in the data? Then our linear regression equation would look like this:

        $$
        y = B_0 + B_1 x
        $$

        where we've converted our betas to random variables as follows:

        $$
        B_0 \sim N(\beta_0, \sigma^2)
        $$

        $$
        B_1 \sim N(\beta_1, \sigma^2)
        $$

        This reads "$B_0$ is a random variable distributed according to a Gaussian with mean $\beta_0$ and variance $\sigma^2$".
        We'll set $\sigma^2$ to be the variance of the data about the best fit line (the variance of the residuals). For the plots a and b above, then we'd have:

        $$
        y_a = B_{0a} + B_{1a} x
        $$

        $$
        y_b = B_{0b} + B_{1b} x
        $$

        where $B_0$ and $B_1$ are gaussians with variance equal to the variance of the residuals in each case: $\sigma^2_a$ and $\sigma^2_b$


        Now that the betas are random variables, let's sample from them, and plot the resulting lines:

        Notice what we've created: it's a distribution over _functions_. Each sample from  $y = B_0 + B_1 x$ is a different function $f(x)$. Also notice that as you sample more and more, the "spread" or uncertainty of the original fit becomes more and more apparent. You can also see that the uncertainty is higher in the noisier data.

        What about multivariate Gaussians? That is, a Gaussian distribution but with more than one variable. They are basically the same thing, but instead of having a single mean and variance, there's there's a mean vector and a covariance matrix. 


        So while a single Gaussian is this:

        $$
        Y \sim N(\mu, \sigma^2)
        $$

        Where $\mu$ is the mean and $\sigma$ is the variance, a multivariate Gaussian is this:

        $$
        \textbf{Y} \sim N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \Sigma)
        $$

        Where $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is a vector of means, $\Sigma$ is a covariance matrix.

        $$
        \boldsymbol{\mu} = \begin{bmatrix}
        \mu_1 \\
        \mu_2 \\
        \vdots \\
        \mu_n
        \end{bmatrix},
        $$

        $$

        Cool, so now we can visualize samples from a 50-D Gaussian in this kinda of weird way. How is this useful? And how does this relate to a Gaussian Process regression?

        You'll notice the above plot has a "Connect Samples" button. If you click it, each variable in a given sample gets connected to the next. Try it out!

        Do these connected samples remind you of anything? Maybe a certain class of elementary mathematical objects?

        If you thought "functions" then you are getting what I'm going for here. Each sample from the 50-D Gaussian is starting to look like some curve where, for any x-coordinate (which is just the index of the vector output of the multivariate gaussian) you can look up a y-value. So this kinda-sorta function can be defined as 

        $$
        f(x) = Y_{x}
        $$

        given a multivariate Gaussian $Y = [Y_1, Y_2, Y_3, \dots, Y_{x}]^T \sim N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \Sigma)$.

        But remember what each different colored curve is: it's a sample from a multivariate normal distribution. It's almost like the 50-D Gaussian specifies a _distribution over functions_...

        <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/007/630/conspiracykeanu.jpg" width="340" height="200" />

        _Almost_. The 50-D Gaussian really only specifies a distribution over 50 discrete values, so it's not quite a distribution over functions $f(x)$ that can take _any_ value of $x$. Hold that thought for now, we'll return to this later. 

        But first you might have some questions. Remember, the above plot was made by taking a few samples from 50-D gaussian, $\textbf{Y}_{50D} \sim N(\boldsymbol{\mu}, \Sigma)$

        But I didn't tell you what $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ and $\Sigma$ were. Well, I actually used a mean vector of all zeros:

        $$
        \boldsymbol{\mu} =  \begin{bmatrix}
        0 \\
        0 \\
        \vdots \\
        0
        \end{bmatrix},
        $$

        and for the covariance matrix I simply used the Identity matrix.

        $$
        \Sigma = \begin{bmatrix}
        1 & 0 & \dots & 0 \\
        0 & 1 & \dots & 0 \\
        \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
        0 & 0 & \dots & 1
        \end{bmatrix}.

        ### Making these "functions" into Functions
        We've been throwing around the word "functions" a lot now, but we still never resolved the problem that these samples are really just 50-D vectors. Sure we can connect the points with little lines, but that's not the same as a function. How do we get a distribution over true functions?

        The answer lies in how we define the covariance and mean of our multivariate Gaussian. So far we've been manually inputting some mean vector and covariance matrix. Since these are objects with discrete, finite elements, we can't really think of the distributions they define as functions. But what if we could redefine these objects (the mean and covariance) as functions? 

        Mathematically:

        $$
        \boldsymbol{\mu} = m(\textbf{x}) \\
        \Sigma = k(\textbf{x, x})
        $$

        Now for whatever $x$ we are interested in, we can sample from a multivariate Gaussian with mean $m(\textbf{x})$ and covariance $k(\textbf{x, x})$. This is one of those mathematical tricks that's so simple it's hard to understand, or maybe feels like cheating, so let's go through an example. 

        Say we want to sample from a few specific real number $\textbf{x} = [-\pi, \pi, 2\pi]^T$ (some multiples of pi, as in 3.141...). First let's define a mean function $m(\textbf{x})$. We can use anything we like, so let's so something really simple: $m(\textbf{x}) = \textbf{x}$. 

        For the covariance function $k(\textbf{x, x})$, we need a function of x that generates a symmetric matrix with a positive diagonal (otherwise it would not be a valid covariance). Again let's just do something really simple: $k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}) = \operatorname{diag}(\textbf{x} \odot \textbf{x} )$, where we take $\odot$ to mean the element-wise product of $\textbf{x}$ with $\textbf{x}$.

        > You maybe be wondering, "why define the covariance function as $k(\textbf{x, x})$ instead of simply $k(\textbf{x})$?". The reason is that covariance functions in general calculate a covariance between two vectors that are not necessarily the same. Here we are just calculating the covariance of $\textbf{x}$ with itself, but this will not always be the case...

        So if we put out test vector into these functions we get:

        $$
        \boldsymbol{\mu} = m(\textbf{x}) = \textbf{x} = [-\pi, \pi, 2\pi]^T\\
        $$

        $$
        \Sigma = k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}) = \operatorname{diag}(\textbf{x}\odot\textbf{x}) = \begin{bmatrix}
        (-\pi)^2 & 0 & 0 \\
        0 & (\pi)^2 & 0 \\
        0 & 0 & (2\pi)^2
        \end{bmatrix}
        $$

        Now we can sample from a multivariate Gaussian at these specific values of $x$:

        ## Conditioning on Data

        Wow, we've come a long way. Let's regroup here and remember our original definition of a Gaussian Process Regression.

        **GP Regression: <font color="#32a852">A Multivariate Gaussian Distribution over functions</font>, conditioned on some training data.**

        > In fact this highlighted part above is the definition of a Gaussian Process. But we want "Gaussian Process Regression". (People sometimes use the two to mean the same thing, but technically GP is the distribution and GPR is the regression problem.)

        We're more than half-way done! But we still need to condition it on some training data. Right now we're just sampling these pretty functions, but they are completely random. 

        Conditioning means we want the probability of some outcome given some data. Mathematically we write this as:

        $$
        p(y | x)
        $$

        that is, the probability of some outcome $y$ given some other data $x$. 

        Let's take a simple toy problem as a concrete example:

        Say we are trying to predict the cost of a house along a particular road. At one end of the road, there is a nuclear power plant (yikes!). We have some data on the cost of some of the houses on this road, but we want to predict the cost of a house at any location. Let's look at the data first:

        Right away we see a couple things. Housing costs are not just linearly increasing as we get further away from the plant; there seem to be a few dips. Maybe there is a prison 5 miles away from the plant; who knows. Regardless, we probably want some non-linear model for this data. 

        The main question at hand is given this known cost data, what is the expected cost of a house at another location $x$?

        To state this mathematically, we want some function structured as follows:

        $$
        p(\textbf{c} | \textbf{x})
        $$

        That is, we want the probability distribution of cost of a house $c$, given its distance $x$ from the nuclear plant. Since we've been thinking about multivariate Gaussian, let's make an assumption that the distribution above follows a multivariate Gaussian.

        $$
        p(\textbf{c} | \textbf{x}) \sim N(m(\textbf{x}), k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}))
        $$

        Where $k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x})$ is the covariance function, and $m(\textbf{x})$ is the mean function. For now we'll just assume that the mean function is zero, and for the covariance function we'll use the RBF kernel. 

        Why these? Remember the RBF function's effect above: it sort of "smooths" out the data. This makes sense to model housing prices, because it's reasonable to expect that houses near each other will have similar prices. 

        > But why is the mean function zero? A: trust me bro. It just works out in practice that mean = 0 is usually good enough to model the data. For example sklearn's GP implementation doesn't even let you specify a mean function. For more on this see [Section 2.7 here](http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW2.pdf).

        We really need the following if we want to condition on the known data:

        $$
        p(\textbf{c} | \textbf{x}, \textbf{c}_{\text{known}}, \textbf{x}_{\text{known}})
        $$

        Putting this into words, we want the probability distribution of prices of a house, given its location _and_ given the prices of houses at some other locations.

        Let's assume that the known data also came from the same multivariate Gaussian distribution as the unknown. So we can write:


        $$
        p(\textbf{c}_{\text{known}}| \textbf{x}_{\text{known}}) \sim N(0, k(\textbf{x}_{\text{known}}, \textbf{x}_{\text{known}}))
        $$

        And for the unknown data, remember we had:

        $$
        p(\textbf{c} | \textbf{x}) \sim N(0, k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}))
        $$

        Notice that we've assumed both the known data and the unknown data come from multivariate Gaussians. What if we just combined them into one big multivariate gaussian? We could basically just stack the distributions on top of each other to form a big "mother" Gaussian.

        $$
        p(\begin{bmatrix} \textbf{c} \\ \textbf{c}_{\text{known}} \end{bmatrix} | \begin{bmatrix} \textbf{x} \\ \textbf{x}_{\text{known}} \end{bmatrix}) \sim N\left(\begin{bmatrix}0 \\ 0\end{bmatrix}, \begin{bmatrix}k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}) & k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}_{\text{known}}) \\ k(\textbf{x}_{\text{known}}, \textbf{x}) & k(\textbf{x}_{\text{known} }, \textbf{x}_{\text{known}})\end{bmatrix}\right)
        $$

        The one wrinkle here is the covariance function. For the off-diagonal elements, we need to use the covariance function between the unknown data and the known data. So _now_ we see why the kernel function is written as $k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x})$; in this case we need to compute the covariance between two different vectors of data to fill in the off-diagonal blocks of the covariance matrix above.

        Now question is can we massage the beast above into a probability distribution conditioned on the known data? Like so:

        $p(\textbf{c} | \textbf{x}, \textbf{c}_{\text{known}}, \textbf{x}_{\text{known}}) \sim ???$

        The answer is yes. It's the following:

        $$
        p(\textbf{c} | \textbf{x}, \textbf{c}_{\text{known}}, \textbf{x}_{\text{known}}) \sim N\left(m(\textbf{x}) + k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}_{\text{known}})k(\textbf{x}_{\text{known}})^{-1}(\textbf{c}_{\text{known}} - m(\textbf{x}_{\text{known}})), k(\textbf{x}) - k(\textbf{x}, \textbf{x}_{\text{known}})k(\textbf{x}_{\text{known}})^{-1}k(\textbf{x}_{\text{known}}, \textbf{x})\right)
        $$

        > Please don't get mad at me for just giving you the answer. It's a kind of complicated derivation, and I don't want us to get bogged down. If you want to go through it, see this section of [Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning](http://gaussianprocess.org/gpml/chapters/RW.pdf#page=218&zoom=50,240,358). 
        >
        > For now, just accept that there's a nice closed form solution to this problem.

        Using our conditional distribution above, we can plug in our known house costs to create a conditional distribution of functions. Then we can sample from this distribution at, say, 50 evenly spaced distance from 0 to 12 miles away from the nuclear plant.

        We have 15 known cost data points. This means that $\textbf{c}_{\text{known}}$ and $\textbf{x}_{\text{known}}$ is are vectors of length 15. We want to predicted prices at 50 evenly spaced points, so $\textbf{x}$ and $\textbf{c}$ are vectors of length 50. 

        Plugging this into the conditional distribution above, we can now sample from the conditional distribution of functions:

            - (You should already be able to figure out the answer to this!)
        - "How do we choose a kernel function?" 
        - "How do we choose the best parameters for the kernel function?" 
        - "What if the training data is intrinsically noisy (the price of houses has some variance at a given location)
          "
        - "What if there are many features in my training data? E.g. Square footage of houses."
